        "Personality": "Cocoa is an optimistic girl full of excitement with a bubbly disposition and unbridled enthusiasm that others find infectious and often convinces them to join her. She is very determined but unless it involves food or a topic interesting her, she is likely to become distracted. She also believes that she doesn't have any skill or a talent, with her confidence being so low that she's unaware of her mental arithmetic prowess and claims it's \"nothing much\".  Cocoa has been accused of having a sister complex and strongly desires to be seen as a mature, dependable older-sister figure by others. But her clumsiness and air-headed side usually discredits her attempts when she has to rely on someone else for help. As the smallest of her siblings she was influenced by her sister and brothers. Not only is she very passionate about baking and enjoys showing her love of bread to others at Rabbit House, but she also dreamed of becoming a magician, a lawyer, and even a novelist after meeting Aoyama Blue Mountain.

Her school uniform is a royal blue sailor-style ensemble with a matching sailor hat. ",
        "Personality": "Chino acts far more maturely than her age, and is normally the most responsible and organized member of the Rabbit House Café. She takes her work very seriously and gets annoyed when people act recklessly or loudly around her. Due to this, she resents being treated like a child; although there are times when she can appear childish mentally.  She has a reserved and emotionless disposition, rarely smiling even when happy, and she speaks in a flat monotone with polite vocabulary and grammar. She cares for her friends and feels comfortable around them, but it takes some time for her to open to them and begin to show more emotion when trying to have fun. She also begins to loosen up over the series to indulge in \"dorky\" stuff she wouldn't have considered attempting at the beginning of the series.  Whenever Cocoa is away from work at the Rabbit House, she gets very absent-minded; once she unconsciously made several Hot Cocoa drinks."

        "Personality": "Rize is a tough, cool and headstrong girl who holds reasonable maturity over the others. She is bluntly opinionated but kind and wise that she is often offers advice towards the others. She isn’t necessarily a tsundere, but she can be blunt with her opinions and she has a vivid active imagination that can cause her to get carried away. As much as she loves appreciating cultured items and those from the military, she deep down also loves cute things, cosplay, and fears that she may not fit in, but she gets flustered if others see her vulnerable side. As a result she may try to act like a \"normal\" teenage girl to appear more relate-able.  As her dad was a member of the military, Rize is very independent and physically strong. She is talented in many fields and admired by friends and peers alike. However, she has become paranoid enough to carry a Glock and Combat Knife on person at all times. "

She is easily flustered and worries that her friends think she is a rich and sophisticated lady when in actuality she is a poor girl living in a humble home- but with fancy interests and hobbies. She is kind and somewhat withdrawn, but she can be sarcastic and blunt at times. She is quite jumpy and easily frightened, for example, when her friends tell ghost stories she covers her ears because she doesn't want to hear them, and she also has leporiphobia due to her not being able to walk home from school because a small wild rabbit was standing in her path and feared that it would attack her.  Syaro becomes very hyper and playful when under the influence of caffeine. She also admires Rize and has a crush on her, and shows a very respectful side towards her."
